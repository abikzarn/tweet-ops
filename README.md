# Tweet-Ops: A Complete DevOps CI/CD Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of DevOps practices and tools integration. The main goal was to create a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Twitter-based application while learning and implementing various DevOps technologies and their interactions.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was created to gain hands-on experience with:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
- Configuration Management with Ansible
- Containerization with Docker
- Container Orchestration with Kubernetes
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Code Quality Analysis
- Monitoring and Observability

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project implements a complete DevOps pipeline with the following components:

### Infrastructure (Terraform)
- VPC configuration with public subnets
- EKS cluster setup
- Security groups configuration
- Jenkins master and build nodes provisioning

### Configuration (Ansible)
- Jenkins master configuration
- Build nodes setup
- Required software installation and configuration

### CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
- Multi-branch pipeline implementation
- Maven build process
- Unit testing
- SonarQube analysis
- Docker image building and pushing
- Kubernetes deployment

### Application Deployment (Kubernetes)
- Namespace management
- Secrets handling
- Deployment configuration
- Service exposure
- Monitoring setup
